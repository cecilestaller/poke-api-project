# Poke-API / React Project

- This project was created as part of a Full-Stack Webdeveloper bootcamp from supercode.
- we worked on the project in a group of four
- We had two days to plan and implement the project, after which we presented it to the entire course

- The learning objective of the project:
- plan and implement a larger project in the group
- git workflow in a group
- internalize the handling of useState-, useEffect- and useContext-hooks in react
- the dynamic creation of detail pages using an API and the react npm package: react-router-dom

## How does the Poke-App work?

- On the home page the user gets an overview of all pokemons of the first generation
- if the user clicks on a pokemon, he is redirected to a detail page that provides more information about the pokemon
- the user can search for a specific pokemon in the search bar
- the user can apply various filters to display only pokemons of a certain type
